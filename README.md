# AVCteam1
AVC stuff. 
##Checklist for Week One
- [x] Hardware: Plan the robot, and create a prototype of how the robot will work most efficently
- [ ] Software: working out what the values the sensor are going to give
- [x] Software: How to send code to the pi
- [x] Software: Constructing code for the robot to go forwards
- [x] Simran: Write a progress report for week one

##Week One Review
- We planned the robot, and we were able to make a prototype of the robot and see if it was efficent enough *(this is a base for the        robot so that it is in a functional state to test code with)*.
- Since we did not get how to work out what the sensor values are going to give, the software team will try completing this task next       week.
- We connected up the pi, and were able to send code to it
- Everyone has signed the AVC plan and submitted it.
- We all attended the labs/meetings held

##Checklist for Week Two
- [x] Hardware: Choose the design for the robot
- [x] Software: Fix the bug (get_pixel() returning a row out of range error, *row and col values needed to be swapped*)
- [ ] Software: Working out what the values the sensor are going to give
- [ ] Software: Try get the robot to follow the line for quadrant one
- [ ] Simran: Write a progress report for week two
- [ ] Simran: Plan a structure for the progress report

##Week Two Review
- The hardware have decided on the design/theme of the robot *(focus on being short in length for maze corners)*
    Side affect of short design is robot is tall making it unstable in abrupt turns, due to this may change to small wheels to reduce height
- We were able to fix the bug we encountered in the lab by swapping row and col values in the get_Pixel()
- Everyone attended the lab this week

##Checklist for Week Three
- [ ] Hardware: Start printing
