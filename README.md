# AVCteam Numoro Uno
AVC stuff. 
##Checklist for Week One
- [x] Hardware: Plan the robot, and create a prototype of how the robot will work most efficently
- [ ] Software: working out what the values the sensor are going to give
- [x] Software: How to send code to the pi
- [x] Software: Constructing code for the robot to go forwards
- [x] Simran: Write a progress report for week one

##Week One Review
- We planned the robot, and we were able to make a prototype of the robot and see if it was efficent enough *(this is a base for the robot so that it is in a functional state to test code with)*.
- Since we did not get how to work out what the sensor values are going to give, the software team will try completing this      task next week.
- We connected up the pi, and were able to send code to it
- Everyone has signed the AVC plan and submitted it.
- We all attended the labs/meetings held

##Checklist for Week Two
- [x] Hardware: Choose the design for the robot
- [x] Software: Fix the bug (get_pixel() returning a row out of range error, *row and col values needed to be swapped*)
- [x] Software: Working out what the values the sensor are going to give
- [ ] Software: Try get the robot to follow the line for quadrant one
- [x] Simran: Write a progress report for week two
- [x] Simran: Plan a structure for the progress report

##Week Two Review
- The hardware have decided on the design/theme of the robot *(focus on being short in length for maze corners)*
    Side affect of short design is robot is tall making it unstable in abrupt turns, due to this may change to small wheels to reduce height
- We were able to fix the bug we encountered in the lab by swapping row and col values in the get_Pixel()
- We were not able to get the robot to follow the line for quadrant one (the robot kept spinning in a circle, this is happened   because we had an error in the code), we will complete this in week three.
- Everyone attended the lab this week

##Checklist for Week Three
- [ ] Hardware: Start printing
- [ ] Software: Fix error in the code to make he robot follow the line for quadrant one
- 
- [ ] Simran: Weekly Report

##Week Three Review
- Everyone attended the Lab session
- Hardware: We are putting the camera on the angle because we can see the line and what is on either side of it because before   we had the camera facing straight down and it could only see the line and is isn't able to see whats on either side of the     line.
- We fixed the wheels spinning by ......
