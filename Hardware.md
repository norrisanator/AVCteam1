Week 1. Plan 
The plan for hardware is get the bot to be set up to be functional to be able to access all ports without having to remove parts. Also to be small enough to be able to move through the maze with ease. 


Week 2. Decisions 
We have assembled the bot in to a basic small frame that fits everything above the two motor wheels, with a rotating back wheel. The power board and raspberry pi are mounted above one another in a two tier layout. We believe this to best functional layout we access to all inputs, as well as space for the battery. The Camera is mounted to the cassis with a two hinge arm that holds it out at any required angle. We have used the medium size wheels (6cm) which we believe to be the best size for the bot.



Week 3. Testing
While testing the bot we discovered that the bot was a little unstable, the battery was not holding its place and the camera mount was moving around. This caused us to switch down to the smaller wheels bringing the centre of gravity down. We took the arm off the camera mount and then creating a new mount with the parts from the old one. Then attaching the camera directly to the cassis point directly towards the ground to read the line. Using one of the hinges from the camera mount and some other supports we managed to get a battery support. 



Week 4. First quadrant. 
First time using the alterations from week3, we found out that the camera needed to on a slight angle. Using parts that we had we got the camera on to a single hinge mount and got it into a stable position. The bot successfully went through the first quadrant! 
We are now looking at getting mounts for the 3 I.R sensors that will get the bot through the maze.
